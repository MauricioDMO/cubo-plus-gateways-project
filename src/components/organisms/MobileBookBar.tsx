 * past all of it to act. The bar is always there.
 *
 * It asks for the dates itself rather than only linking down to the form.
 * Two taps -- pick the nights, then reserve -- and the form the guest lands on
 * already holds those dates, because both read the same provider
 * (modules/bookings/providers/BookingDates.tsx). Sending someone to an empty form after they
 * have already told you when they want to come is how a booking is lost.

          Still an anchor, so it works with no JavaScript at all -- but the
          href alone was not enough, and this is why.

          Pressing it a second time did nothing. A browser only acts on a
          fragment link when the fragment CHANGES; once the address bar already
          said #book -- which it does from the first press, and on any page
          opened from a link that carried it -- the second press was inert. A
          guest sitting on the form, having filled it in, pressing the one
          button on screen labelled "Reserve now", got nothing back.

          So the click does the work: scroll to the form if it is not on
          screen, and submit it if it is. That second half is what the label
          promised all along. Empty fields make the browser's own validation
          fire and point at the first one, which is the answer to "why can't I
          book", rather than another press that changes nothing.
