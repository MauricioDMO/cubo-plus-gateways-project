/*
 * One set of dates for the whole listing page.
 *
 * The phone booking bar asks for the dates and the booking form takes the
 * reservation; they are different components at opposite ends of a long page,
 * and if each keeps its own state the guest picks dates in the bar, presses
 * Reserve now, and lands on a form that has forgotten them. That is the bug
 * this exists to prevent -- it is the whole reason the bar was worth building.
 *
 * The provider is optional. Where no provider is above it, useBookingDates
 * falls back to component-local state, so BookingWidget still works on its own
 * (the checkout page mounts one with no bar anywhere).
